           <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size:xx-large;"> This is  first html project of my life and all of you are welcome here
            <br/> This article is based on Shri guru granth sahib ji and sikh religion
            Sikhi was started by Guru nanak sahib ji . The main goal of the first guru was to preach his way of living
             After guru nanak sahib ji , bhai lehna ji was selected to be the second guru
            of sikhs who were following the nanak ji and his teachings. This continued till the 10th guru , Guru gobind singh ji and than after Shri guru granth sahib ji 
            was made the Guru of the sikhs by 10th guru.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: xx-large; font-family: cursive;">Shri guru granth sahib ji (SGGS) is a holy scripture for the sikhs from 1755.
               sggs teaches us the way of living the life. <br/>As per Sggs, the main goal of the life is to make 
               your life truthfull and live according to the will of the almighty. <b>
               Japji Sahib </b> The first bani in Sggs by Guru Nanak sahib is the core of gurbani 
               .The teaching of writtings of sggs is known as gurbani. There are total <b>1430</b> pages of sggs known as angs (limbs)      
               The Sggs includes writings of 6 Gurus (From 1st guru to 5th guru and 9th guru) and 26 bhagats. The gurbani
               is written in the form of raags. There are 31 raags in total. This was some information on Sggs.

            <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: xx-large;">
                Now lets talk why i have chose to write a article on Sggs as my most admired thing. I don't 
                know who will see this html so i am writing in general language. Sggs is the most admired thing in my life
                because the way i live my life is totally changed after learning from the teachings of sggs. 
                My way of thinking is totaly changed.
            </p>

            <p style="font-family:cursive; font-size:xx-large;" translate="no">
                So My life is changing even now every. The more i learn from sggs the more
                my thinking is being broad. There is pangti <q><b style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Sahib mera nit nava,Sada
                sada datar.</b></q> <q><img src="sahib mera neet nava.png" ></q>. Which translates to
                my sahib (guru) is always new , he(it) always gives me blessings. And the meaning is 
                whenever i learn from my guru his teachings is always new, even the same writings give me the new meanings
                . I have experienced this pangti and it is true.
